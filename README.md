sidenote - the algorithm for finding the mean from 2 given arrays, in O(log(m+n)) 
- I thought about about a solution where you could just binary search one of the arrays, until you get to either the 
mean, or you know that you have to search the other array (because index(n) is too small, and idx(n+1) is too big)...
but then the entire other array could be fitted inside i(n) and i(n+1)... is that still a O(log(m+n))??
